    <div class="story">
        <p>William "Billy" Barnes Jr. (November 17, 1866 – June 25, 1930) was a newspaper publisher and politician who
            rose to the
            position of political "boss" for the Republican Party in Albany County. Barnes served as the Republican
            committee’s
            chairman from 1911 to 1914. He was also the owner and publisher of the Albany Evening Journal.</p>
        <p>Barnes could be willfully cagey about his role as the political boss in Albany. As described in an October
            24, 1911, New
            York Times article, <a class="breadcrumb-item inactive-link"
                href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/10/25/104840456.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0"
                target="_blank">"Barnes Dodges All Political
                Questions"</a>,
            Barnes was evasive when responding to
            questions
            posed by a
            New York State Senate committee meeting investigating how Albany was being run. When asked by the
            Committee's counsel
            "You are the leader of the political party in this county, are you not?" Barnes, replied "I don’t recognize
            any such
            office." His evasiveness continued from there.</p>
        <p>In addition to his local influence in Albany, Barnes played a major role in national politics, working with
            Thomas C.
            Platt to secure presidential victories for William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft.
            When Roosevelt
            later ran as an independent (against Taft), he accused Barnes of being a corrupt party boss in league with
            Charles
            Murphy, the "Boss" of the Democrat-run Tammany Hall political machine. Barnes sued Roosevelt for libel in
            1915, but
            ultimately lost in court.</p>
        <p>The Barnes political machine in Albany ended in 1921 with the mayoral victory of Democrat William Hackett.
