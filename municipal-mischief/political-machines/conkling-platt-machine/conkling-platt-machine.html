    <p class="page-title">The Conkling-Platt Machine</p>

    <div class="story">
        <p>Prior to becoming the 21st President of the U.S., Chester A. Arthur served as the machine’s chief functionary
            – as
            Collector of the New York Customhouse, which brought in almost 80% of federal revenue and was the largest
            source of
            political patronage in the country.</p>
        <p>Two presidents - Rutherford Hayes and James Garfield - tried to break the machine, with Garfield succeeding
            only
            temporarily. Hayes at one point nominated Theodore Roosevelt’s father to control the NY customhouse - a
            direct challenge
            to Conkling - but Conkling blocked him, helping form a young Teddy Roosevelt’s views on reform.</p>
        <p>When Arthur became president after Garfield’s assassination in 1881, Conkling insisted that President Arthur
            continue to
            take orders from the NY machine. But Arthur pointedly refused and ultimately signed the Pendleton Civil
            Service Act,
            sharply limiting patronage in Federal employment.</p>
        <p>In a twist of fate, in 1900, Platt, the surviving boss, famously pressed to have reform-minded governor Teddy
            Roosevelt
            nominated for Vice President to keep him from interfering in the machine’s business in Albany. While Platt
            managed to
            remove Roosevelt from Albany, he couldn’t foresee that TR would one day himself become President.</p>
