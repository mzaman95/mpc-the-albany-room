    <p class="page-title">The Corning-O'Connell Machine</p>

    <div class="story">
        <p>Since 1919, Albany had nurtured a local political machine that was among the most powerful and autocratic in
            the
            country. A state investigation in the early 1970s had uncovered payoffs and overcharges in his office of 500
            percent or
            more, and stories of political strong-arm tactics, vote rigging, and the like were regular features in the
            local press.
        </p>
        <p>As a result of machine politics, Erastus Corning II, would serve as Mayor of Albany for over 40 years
            (1942-1983),
            longer than any other mayor of a U.S. city. While Corning held the position of mayor, the real power rested
            with Party
            Chairman Dan O’Connell and a handful of lieutenants.</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Life Under the Machine</p>
        <p>Beyond coercion and strong-arm tactics, the machine also built its power base by providing services to Albany
            voters
            who, in turn, supported the machine with their votes. These services included government jobs, preferential
            tax
            treatment, or prompt repairs to streets or sidewalks. Services were delivered through a network of
            neighborhood “ward
            heelers,” machine agents who made it their business to walk the neighborhoods and know the needs and
            political views of
            everyone on the street. Voters who registered Republican or were seen voting against the machine often
            suffered
            unexpected tax hikes or denial of basic city services.</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Decline of the Machine</p>
        <p>The Corning-O'Connell machine remained robust until the late 1960s when a changing political climate and the
            decline of
            traditional machine politics began to take hold. New laws and reforms aimed at reducing the influence of
            political
            machines also played a role.
        </p>
        <p class="section-heading">Voting</p>
        <p>Over the years, Albany pols, learning from professionals like New York City’s Tammany Hall, found endless
            ways to cheat
            on Election Day with paper ballots or primitive voting machines. The list was endless: hiding pencil leads
            under a
            fingernail to invalidate ballots, placing vote machines at an open window to read them from the back,
            crooked counts,
            ballot stuffing, personal pressure, and paying $5 per vote.</p>

        <p class="section-heading">$5 Vote</p>
        <p>The "$5 vote" was a term used to describe a controversial and corrupt practice that occurred in Albany, New
            York, during
            the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a method employed by political machines to manipulate
            elections and
            secure votes through bribery. Operatives would identify potential voters and offer them money in exchange
            for their
            promise to vote for a specific candidate or party supported by the political machine. This practice allowed
            the
            political machine to exert control over the electorate by effectively buying votes and ensuring that voters
            supported
            the machine's preferred candidates.</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Patronage</p>
        <p>Patronage, the handing out of government jobs in exchange for political loyalty, is as old as politics
            itself, but
            political machines like Albany’s took the practice to extremes. Albany was famous for its many sinecure jobs
            involving
            no actual work, its hundreds of leave rakers, street sweepers, and clerkships, often handed out to relatives
            of donors
            and political supporters. Patronage can be a helpful charity, providing income to someone who’s lost a job
            or fallen on
            hard times. But most often it was used to pay for favors and build support.</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Housing</p>
        <p>Albany residents who dared to register Republican or publicly oppose the machine-backed might find the real
            estate tax
            assessment on their home drastically rising for no apparent reason. To fix the problem, the homeowner would
            have to hire
            a lawyer with machine connections. The machine benefitted at both ends: punishing an opponent and rewarding
            a friend
            (the machine-connected lawyer who collected a nice fee).</p>
        <p class="section-heading">Beer</p>
        <p>The Hedrick Brewing Company opened in 1933 and closed in 1965. Originally a bootlegging operation, the
            Hedrick Brewing
            Company came under the control of party boss Dan O’Connell. Under his control, Albany establishments faced
            pressure to sell Hedrick Beer to help line O’Connell’s coffers.</p>
