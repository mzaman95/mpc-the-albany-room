                    "details": "By 1825, The Argus was published as a daily newspaper.  The new publisher, Edwin Croswell had been encouraged to join the paper by then-State Senator Martin Van Buren and his political associates known as the Albany Regency.  The Regency became one of the first American political machines dominating New York State’s government between 1822 and 1838. The Argus was the Regency’s voice, echoing Van Buren’s positions on issues like the construction of the Erie Canal and the establishment of a national bank.  The Albany Regency purported to be against political corruption, but also created the “spoils system” which rewards the supporters of a party with government positions given to friends (cronyism) and relatives (nepotism).  By the time The Argus was closed in 1921, it had helped elect President Grover Cleveland.  Cleveland’s Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel Manning, had been the owner of The Argus, and John H. Manning, Daniel’s son, was the current owner…and the Mayor of Albany.",

Glynn (a one-year Governor of New York who remained as governor while still running the paper) the Times Union began supporting and taking favors from the O’Connell-Corning Democratic machine. When Gene Robb became publisher in the early 1960’s, theTimes Union became a  critic of the Democratic machine. ",
