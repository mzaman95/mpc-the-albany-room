        <p>In 1868, Jay Gould arrived in Albany carrying a cash-filled suitcase.</p>
        <p>He had previously schemed to undermine Cornelius Vanderbilt’s attempt to buy the Erie Railroad by flooding
            the market
            with newly-created Erie stock. When Vanderbilt uncovered the plot, a “friendly” judge issued a citation for
            Gould’s
            arrest, but he fled to Jersey City.
        </p>
        <p>In Albany, Gould emptied his suitcase of today’s equivalent of about $7 million, getting the legislature to
            pass a
            retroactive bill favorable to him and paying off Vanderbilt’s judge for his freedom. By fall of 1868, Gould
            achieved his
            goal and had control of the Erie Railroad.
